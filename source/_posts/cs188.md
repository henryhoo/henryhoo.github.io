## Search

### Basic ideas

#### Search Problem
* A state space.
* A successor function (with actions, costs).
* A start state and a goal test.

#### Solution
A sequence of actions which transforms the start state to a goal state.

### Uninformed Search  
All search algorithms are the same except for fringe strategies

#### Example
* Traveling in Romania (Map with weighted edge)
* Pac-man game planning

#### Properties
* Complete: Guaranteed to find a solution if one exists?
* Optimal: Guaranteed to find the least cost path?
* Time and space complexity.

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Complete if we prevent cycles
* Not optimal
* Time O(b^m)
* Space O(bm)

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Complete
* Optimal only if costs are all 1
* Time O(b^s)
* Space O(b^s)

#### Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
* Complete and optimal
* Time O(b^(C*/E))  
* Space O(b^(C*/E))
* **Problem**: Explores options in every “direction” because no information about goal location

### Informed Search
Introduced heuristic to estimate of distance to nearest goal for each state and therefore speed up search (Solve performance problem of UCS).

#### Example
* Pancake Problem
* Pac-man game planning

#### Greedy Search
* Expand the node that seems closest
* **Can be wrong** because of this (not optimal)

#### A*: Combining UCS and Greedy
Uniform-cost orders by path cost, or backward cost **g(n)**. Greedy orders by goal proximity, or forward cost **h(n)**. A* Search orders by the sum: **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**.

##### Admissibility
* Inadmissible (pessimistic) heuristics break optimality by trapping good plans on the fringe
* Admissible (optimistic) heuristics slow down bad plans but never outweigh true costs
* A heuristic h is admissible (optimistic) if: 0 <= h(n) <= h*(n) where h*(n) is the true cost to a nearest goal.

##### Consistency
Heuristic “arc” cost ≤ actual cost for each arc: h(A) – h(C) ≤ cost(A to C)

##### Heuristic design
A* is **optimal** with admissible/consistent heuristics. In general, most natural admissible heuristics tend to be consistent, especially if from relaxed problems so often use relaxed problems.

##### Comparison
