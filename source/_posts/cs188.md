## Search

### Two type of search
#### Planning: sequences of actions
* The path to the goal is the important thing
* Paths have various costs, depths
* Heuristics give problem-specific guidance

#### Identification: assignments to variables
* The goal itself is important, not the path
* All paths at the same depth (for some formulations)
* CSPs are specialized for identification problems

### Uninformed and Informed Search (Planning)
* All search algorithms are the same except for fringe strategies.
* **Informed Search**: Introduced heuristic to estimate of distance to nearest goal for each state and therefore speed up search (Solve performance problem of UCS).

#### Abstraction
* A state space.
* A successor function (with actions, costs).
* A start state and a goal test.

#### Example
* Traveling in Romania (Map with weighted edge)
* Pac-man game planning
* Pancake Problem

#### Properties
* Complete: Guaranteed to find a solution if one exists?
* Optimal: Guaranteed to find the least cost path?
* Time and space complexity.

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Complete if we prevent cycles
* Not optimal
* Time O(b^m)
* Space O(bm)

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Complete
* Optimal only if costs are all 1
* Time O(b^s)
* Space O(b^s)

#### Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
* Complete and optimal
* Time O(b^(C*/E))  
* Space O(b^(C*/E))
* **Problem**: Explores options in every “direction” because no information about goal location

#### Greedy Search
* Expand the node that seems closest
* **Can be wrong** because of this (not optimal)

#### A*: Combining UCS and Greedy
Uniform-cost orders by path cost, or backward cost **g(n)**. Greedy orders by goal proximity, or forward cost **h(n)**. A* Search orders by the sum: **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**.

##### Admissibility
* Inadmissible (pessimistic) heuristics break optimality by trapping good plans on the fringe
* Admissible (optimistic) heuristics slow down bad plans but never outweigh true costs
* A heuristic h is admissible (optimistic) if: 0 <= h(n) <= h*(n) where h*(n) is the true cost to a nearest goal.

##### Consistency
Heuristic “arc” cost ≤ actual cost for each arc: h(A) – h(C) ≤ cost(A to C)

##### Heuristic design
A* is **optimal** with admissible/consistent heuristics. In general, most natural admissible heuristics tend to be consistent, especially if from relaxed problems so often use relaxed problems.

### Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Identification)

#### Abstraction
* A special subset of search problems
* State is defined by variables Xi  with values from a domain D (sometimes D depends on i)
* Goal test is a set of constraints specifying allowable combinations of values for subsets of variables

#### Example
* Map Coloring
* N-Queens
* Cryptarithmetic
* Sudoku

#### Backtracking Search
Backtracking search is the basic uninformed algorithm for solving CSPs

* **idea 1: One variable at a time**: Variable assignments are commutative, so only need to consider assignments to a single variable at each step

* **Idea 2: Check constraints as you go**: Consider only values which do not conflict previous assignments. (Might have to do some computation to check the constraints “Incremental goal test”)

#### Improving Backtracking

##### Filtering
Detect inevitable failure early: Keep track of domains for unassigned variables and cross off bad options.

###### Forward Checking
Cross off values that violate a constraint when added to the existing assignment.

**Disadvantage**: doesn't provide early detection for all failures.

###### Constraint Propagation
Forward checking propagates information from assigned to unassigned variables, but doesn't provide early detection for all failures.

So introduce **Arc consistent**: An arc X->Y is consistent iff for every x in the tail there is some y in the head which could be assigned without violating a constraint.

A simple form of propagation makes sure all arcs are consistent.

**Disadvantage**: Running slow and can not detect all failures.

###### K-Consistency
* 1-Consistency (Node Consistency): Each single node’s domain has a value which meets that node’s unary constraints

* 2-Consistency (Arc Consistency): For each pair of nodes, any consistent assignment to one can be extended to the other

* K-Consistency: For each k nodes, any consistent assignment to k-1 can be extended to the kth node.

###### Strong K-Consistency
k, k-1...1 Consistency which means we can solve without backtracking.

##### Ordering

###### Minimum remaining values (MRV)
Choose the variable with the fewest legal left values in its domain (“Fail-fast” ordering)

###### Least Constraining Value (LCV)
Given a choice of variable, choose the least constraining value which leave more choices for future. I.e., the one that rules out the fewest values in the remaining variables. Note that it may take some computation to determine this!  (E.g., rerunning filtering)

##### Structure

###### Subproblems
Independent subproblems are identifiable as connected components of constraint graph. Solve subproblems Independently will speed things up based on # of variables of subproblems.

###### Tree-Structured CSPs
If the constraint graph has no loops, the CSP can be solved in **O(n d^2)** time compared to general CSPs, where worst-case time is **O(d^n)**

###### Cutset
Instantiate (in all ways) a set of variables such that the remaining constraint graph is a **tree structure CSP**, which reduce runtime to **O((d^c)*(n-c)*d^2)**.

#### Local search: Iterative Algorithms for CSPs
Take an assignment with unsatisfied constraints, operators reassign variable values until problem solved.

##### Performance
The same appears to be true for any randomly-generated CSP except in a narrow range of the ratio
