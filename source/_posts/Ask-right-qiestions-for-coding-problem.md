For a technical interview, it is always better for you to clarify few things before directly jump into coding part. Here is some of the common questions I summarized, I will keep update those questions and welcome anyone who wants to help. Please submit a pull request in this [repo](https://github.com/henryhoo/henryhoo.github.io). (on branch source, source/_posts/Ask-right-qiestions-for-coding-problem.m) Current question is based on JAVA.
