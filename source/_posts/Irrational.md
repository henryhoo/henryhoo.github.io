## Irrationality
* Our decisions are influenced by environment, `defaults` and complexity.
* Defaults are neither good nor bad, and it's everywhere, we should think on when they work for us and when they not.
* The path of least resistance is likely when deviating from the default is complex.
* It's hard for us to make evaluation
* Decisions are influenced by choice set
* Initial decision will influenced future decisions, self herding, so doubt your intuitions

## The psychology of money
### Opportunity cost
We place higher value on specific items than the money value of those items. This is because people tend to take shortcuts when problems are complex. (Do not consider real opportunity cost)

#### Example:
$1000 Pioneer stereo VS $700 Sony stereo VS $1000 Sony stereo with $300 CD coupon

#### Solution:
We should think money in terms of opportunity cost: what you give up for choosing one thing over another

### Relativity
We think money in relative other than absolute.

#### Example:
1. Save $8 on a $16 pen VS save $8 on a $1008 projector
2. Add $2000 for a leather seat for $39,000 car VS Add $2000 for a leather seat for $500 office seat
3. Add feature when renovate house VS select tomato in market
4. Earn 90K as lowest VS earn 80k as highest in different company

#### Solution:
Control range of comparison, think of absolute value.

### Pain of paying
There is a moral tax to consumption. Timing and method of payment affect enjoyment.

#### Example:
1. Pay with credit card over cash
2. Prepaid vacation
3. Gift remove the pain of payment
4. Chips in casino
5. AOL's switch to unlimited plan quadrupled user's usage.

#### Application:
Mortgage, User prediction, gift

### Mental accounting
When money is for a specific category, we value it differently: more easily be spent.
#### Example:
1. Lost a ticket over same amount of money

2. Saving interest rate and loan interest rate

#### Solution:
Partition our spending in advance and keep optimize it.

### Fairness and Reciprocity
Judgement of fair price depends on perceived cost. We use this measurement because determine the real value is hard for us and we use shortcuts (based on effort).
#### Example:
1. Giving a tip to lock locksmith who broke your lock after 2 hours over the one unlock it within 2 minutes without broking it.
2. Pay for ATM over a banker.
3. A beer from hotel or grocery store.

#### Solution:
Express your effort.
