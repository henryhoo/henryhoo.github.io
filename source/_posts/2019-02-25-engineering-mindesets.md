## Accept Non-perfect
This came to my mind when I first start to work for facebook, switiching from git to mercurial. Well it is a pain, not only the change of commands, but missing one of my favourite feature on intellij: Find history for selection. I have been using this feature since I learn Android development, and at that time I assume there is no way to look at a file's history efficiently (`blame` is like a kindergarten feature in my mindset). Until I found `blame` is actually working in most usecase...

There are a lot of similar casese in daily work, when developing a new feature, when finding a library to solve your needs, maybe a non-perfect version already meets all the needs, and you don't need to spend extra 90% energy to make the last 10% improvement, until it is necessary. This practice effectivly gives me more brandwidth to work on more valuable things with finite time.
