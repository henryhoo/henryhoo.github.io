# About me
  My name is Jiaxi (Henry) He. I'm pursuing CS master's degree in NCSU. I'm interested in computer systems, network security and any other trending technologies. I hope to apply my computer knowledge in other areas to make a difference.

  I graduated from China's top IT university, BUPT, with a bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering, where I research on mobile security with [Dr. Min Lei][r5] and [Prof. Yixian Yang][r6]. I also had internship in [ZTE, China][r8] and a [local startup company][r7].

  I like sports, read, travel, movie and cooking.
